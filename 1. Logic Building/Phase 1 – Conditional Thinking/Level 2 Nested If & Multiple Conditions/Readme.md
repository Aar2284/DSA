## 📌 Overview
This folder contains Java programs focused on **nested `if` statements** and **multiple condition checks**.  
The goal of this level is to improve decision-making logic when multiple rules and dependencies exist.

**Phase:** 1 – Conditional Thinking  
**Level:** 2 – Nested If & Multiple Conditions  
**Language:** Java

---
 
## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Nested `if–else`
- Multiple condition evaluation
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Range-based decision making
- Real-world condition modeling

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

1. Check whether **three sides form a valid triangle**
2. If valid, determine the triangle type:
   - Equilateral  
   - Isosceles  
   - Scalene
3. Convert **marks (0–100)** into grades (**A / B / C / D / F**)
4. Check if **one number is a multiple of the other**
5. Print greeting based on **hour of the day (0–23)**:
   - Good Morning  
   - Good Afternoon  
   - Good Evening  
   - Good Night
6. Check **voting eligibility** based on age (18+)
7. Determine if:
   - Both numbers are even  
   - Both are odd  
   - One is even and one is odd
8. Check whether an alphabet lies between:
   - `'a'–'m'` or `'n'–'z'`
9. Print **day name** based on day number (1–7)
10. Print **number of days in a month** (1–12, leap year ignored)
