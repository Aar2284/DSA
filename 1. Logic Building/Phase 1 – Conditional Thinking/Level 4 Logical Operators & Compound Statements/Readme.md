## 📌 Overview
This level focuses on using **logical operators** and **compound conditional statements** to solve slightly more complex, real-world decision problems.

**Phase:** 1 – Conditional Thinking  
**Level:** 4 – Logical Operators & Compound Statements  
**Language:** Java

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Compound conditions
- Conditional precedence
- String condition checks
- Slab-based calculations
- Decision branching with multiple rules

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

1. Check whether a character is:
   - A letter  
   - A digit  
   - Neither
2. Print:
   - **“Fizz”** if divisible by 3  
   - **“Buzz”** if divisible by 5  
   - **“FizzBuzz”** if divisible by both
3. Print the **median** of three numbers (neither max nor min)
4. Determine whether a given **24-hour time** is **AM or PM**
5. Check **tax eligibility** based on:
   - Age > 18  
   - Income > ₹5,00,000
6. Check whether **both numbers are positive** and their **sum < 100**
7. Convert a **single digit (0–9)** into its **word form**
8. Determine whether a day (1–7) is a **weekday or weekend**
9. Calculate **electricity bill** based on unit slabs (using `if–else`)
10. Validate a **password** based on:
    - Minimum length of 8  
    - Contains at least one digit
