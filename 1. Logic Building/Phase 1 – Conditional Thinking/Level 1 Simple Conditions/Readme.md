# Phase 1 – Conditional Thinking 



## 📌 Overview
This folder contains Java solutions for **Phase 1 of DSA fundamentals**, focused on **conditional thinking** using `if`, `else if`, logical operators, and nested conditions.

**Goal:** Build strong decision-making logic using conditions  
**Language:** Java  
**Total Questions (Phase 1):** 50  
**Level Covered Here:** Level 1 – Simple Conditions

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Nested conditions
- Multiple condition checks

---

## ✅ Problems Solved (Level 1)

1. Check whether a number is **positive, negative, or zero**
2. Check if a number is **even or odd**
3. Check if a number is **divisible by 5**
4. Check if a number is **divisible by both 3 and 5**
5. Check whether a given year is a **leap year**
6. Find the **larger of two numbers**
7. Find the **largest of three numbers**
8. Classify temperature as **Cold / Warm / Hot** using ranges
9. Check whether a character is a **vowel or consonant**
10. Check whether a character is:
    - Uppercase
    - Lowercase
    - Digit
    - Special character
